Scaffold library for PHP Code Igniter framework.

[http://ci-scaffold.googlecode.com/files/ci-scaffold-0.91.tar.gz Version 0.91 released].

== Introduction ==

CI-Scaffold generates files based on a pre-defined template, that can be changed to generate it the way you think better.

== Usage ==

You must extract the zip file at system/application/libraries folder and use it as a Code Igniter Library.

You must create a Controller that calls the Scaffold generate method like this:

{{{
<?php

class Admin extends Controller {
    public function __construct(){
        parent::__construct();
    }
    public function index(){
        $this->load->library('scaffold');
        $this->scaffold->generate();
    }
}

}}}

This Controller will list your tables to you select one.

Submiting the table will generate scaffold files for this.

At this example I selected the table "estado". All files necessary to "estado" crud works was generated by CI-scaffold.

== Features ==

Features:
  * MySQL and PostgreSQL drivers for showing tables and get table fields to generate scaffold;
  * Generating MVC for list, create, update, delete table data;
  * Files content based on templates that can be changed;
