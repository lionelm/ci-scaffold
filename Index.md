Scaffold library for PHP Code Igniter framework.

[Version 0.91 released](http://ci-scaffold.googlecode.com/files/ci-scaffold-0.91.tar.gz).

## Introduction ##

CI-Scaffold generates files based on a pre-defined template, that can be changed to generate it the way you think better.

## Usage ##

You must extract the zip file at system/application/libraries folder and use it as a Code Igniter Library.

You must create a Controller that calls the Scaffold generate method like this:

```
<?php

class Admin extends Controller {
    public function __construct(){
        parent::__construct();
    }
    public function index(){
        $this->load->library('scaffold');
        $this->scaffold->generate();
    }
}

```

This Controller will list your tables to you select one.

Submiting the table will generate scaffold files for this.

At this example I selected the table "estado". All files necessary to "estado" crud works was generated by CI-scaffold.
